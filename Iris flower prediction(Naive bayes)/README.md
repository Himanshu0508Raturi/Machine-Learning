# Iris Flower Prediction System

## Overview
The Iris Flower Prediction System is a machine learning-based application designed to classify iris flowers into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. The model is trained using Random Forest, Decision Tree, and Naïve Bayes for high accuracy and performance comparison.

## Features
Machine Learning Models: Implements Random Forest, Decision Tree, and Naïve Bayes.
User Input Form: Accepts petal length, petal width, sepal length, and sepal width.
Data Visualization: Displays classification results using charts and graphs.
Performance Comparison: Compares accuracy of different ML models.
Prediction Result: Instantly classifies the iris flower species based on user input.

## Dataset
The model is trained on the famous Iris Dataset, which contains 150 samples with the following attributes:

Sepal Length
Sepal Width
Petal Length
Petal Width
Species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica)

## Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Machine Learning Libraries: Scikit-Learn, Pandas, NumPy
Visualization Tools: Matplotlib, Seaborn
Web Framework: Streamlit

## Usage
Enter the sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width into the form.
The trained model will analyze the inputs.
The system will display a predicted flower species along with a confidence score.
The app will also compare different model performances.

## Results
Random Forest: Performs well but slightly lower accuracy (~80-85%)
Decision Tree: Moderate performance (~85-90%)
Naïve Bayes: Achieves the highest accuracy (~95-98%)

## Future Enhancements
Deploying the model as a cloud-based web application.
Enhancing accuracy using deep learning techniques.
Adding more interactive visualizations for better user experience.
