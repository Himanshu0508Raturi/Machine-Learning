# Heart Disease Detection System

## Overview
The **Heart Disease Detection System** is a machine learning-based application designed to predict the likelihood of heart disease in patients. This project leverages the **Random Forest algorithm**, along with **Decision Tree** and **NaÃ¯ve Bayes** for comparative analysis, to achieve high accuracy in diagnosis.

## Features
- **Machine Learning Models**: Implements Random Forest, Decision Tree, for prediction.
- **User Input Form**: Accepts various health parameters such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, etc.
- **Data Visualization**: Provides insights using charts and graphs.
- **Performance Comparison**: Displays accuracy comparisons among the three models.
- **Prediction Result**: Indicates whether the patient is at risk of heart disease.

## Dataset
The model is trained on the [Kaggle Heart Disease Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/johnsmith88/heart-disease-dataset), which contains several health-related parameters including:
- Age
- Sex
- Chest Pain Type
- Resting Blood Pressure
- Serum Cholesterol
- Fasting Blood Sugar
- Resting ECG Results
- Maximum Heart Rate Achieved
- Exercise Induced Angina
- ST Depression
- Slope of the Peak Exercise ST Segment
- Number of Major Vessels
- Thalassemia Type

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Machine Learning Libraries**: Scikit-Learn, Pandas, NumPy
- **Visualization Tools**: Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Web Framework**: Streamlit 


## Usage
1. Input patient data into the system.
2. The trained model will analyze the inputs.
3. The system will display a **prediction result** with a confidence score.
4. Comparative performance metrics will be available for reference.

## Results
- **Random Forest**: Achieves the highest accuracy (~85-90%)
- **Decision Tree**: Moderate performance (~75-80%)

## Future Enhancements
- Integration with real-time medical data.
- Deployment as a cloud-based service.
- Enhancing accuracy with deep learning models.
